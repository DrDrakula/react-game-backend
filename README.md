## Super cool game
[Super cool game](https://github.com/DrDrakula/react-game-frontend) is a 2d game where you avoid ghosts, collect coins, and navigate through a maze. It is written in Javascript and utilizes React. The game itself is rendered on a canvas with a tile map, the links in the Navbar are handled with the React Router.

The game uses a Rails API Backend. The backend uses the Bcryp and JWT gems to handle authentication, password encryption, and to provide tokens for each User. Users and scores are persisted in a Postgress server API.
